**Goodcabs-Trips-Analysis**

**Situation:**
Goodcabs has been providing reliable cab services across 10 tier-2 cities for the past two years, establishing itself as a key player in this growing market. As the company sets ambitious targets for 2024, it faces challenges in penetrating markets and increasing trip volume. Goodcabs aims to evaluate its performance against these targets and gain insights through key metrics to identify opportunities for business growth.

**Task:**
The objective was to design a comprehensive dashboard to track key metrics such as trip volume, repeat passenger rate, passenger satisfaction, and fare fairness across cities. The dashboard also needed to assess city-wise performance and analyze demand patterns to guide strategic decision-making.

**Action:**
1.	Data Handling: Imported raw data into MySQL to write queries for addressing ad hoc requests from the Chief of Operations.
2.	Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed data in Power Query, then established relationships between datasets in Power Pivot.
3.	Dashboard Creation: Created KPIs using DAX and visualized insights through dynamic charts, including line charts, bar graphs, and column charts, resulting in an interactive dashboard.

**Result:**
1.	Optimized taxi allocation based on demand patterns, reducing fleet underutilization, saving operational costs, and increasing revenue.
2.	Proposed a loyalty program strategy, leading to an increased repeat passenger rate and sustainable revenue growth.
3.	Introduced fare pricing strategies aligned with demand patterns to build customer trust and maintain competitive pricing.
4.	Recommended tailored marketing campaigns during seasonal peaks and festivals, along with partnerships with local businesses, significantly boosting trip volume.
